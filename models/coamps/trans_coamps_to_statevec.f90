program trans_coamps_to_statevec

! trans_coamps_to_statevec
! ------------------------
! This program pulls pieces out of the large COAMPS restart file,
! then assembles them into a state vector that can be used to show
! what DART is seeing for easier reading into programs like MATLAB
! or debugging.  This program is almost identical to the
! trans_coamps_to_dart program but does not output time.

  use coamps_translate_mod, only : initialize_translator,         &
                                   generate_restart_filenames,    &
